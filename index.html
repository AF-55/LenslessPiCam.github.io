    <h2>An overview on lensless imaging</h2>
    <p>
        Lensless imaging, also known as computational imaging, is a type of imaging technology that does not use traditional lenses to capture images. Instead, it relies on complex algorithms and mathematical models to reconstruct images from the patterns of light that are captured by an image sensor. This approach allows for the creation of extremely thin and flexible cameras, which can be used in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, industrial inspection, and consumer electronics.
        One of the key advantages of lensless imaging is its ability to capture high-resolution images of objects that are too small or too far away to be seen with traditional lenses. This makes it an important tool for scientific research, where it can be used to image microorganisms, nanoparticles, and other tiny objects. It is also useful for industrial inspection applications, where it can be used to detect defects in materials and structures.</p>

    <h2>Mask design</h2>

    <h3><b>Coded aperture</b> (seen in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00116">FlatCam</a> article)</h3>
    <p>
        Coded apertures are masks that contain a specific pattern of transparent and opaque elements that allow only certain portions of the incoming light or radiation to pass through.
    </p>
    <p>    
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Uniformly_Redundant_Array"><b>Modified Uniformly Redundant Arrays (MURA)</b></a>: 
        MURA is a type of amplitude mask first introduced by <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ao-28-20-4344&seq=0&html=true">Gottesman and Fenimore</a> in 1989. 
        It is a two-dimensional array of binary elements, arranged in a manner that ensures uniform redundancy in the encoding process. 
        The code to obtain such masks was inspired from the code available in <a href="https://github.com/kkretschmer/MURA.jl">this repository</a>.
        The MURA pattern is generated by starting with a uniformly spaced grid of points and then perturbing the positions of the points by small random amounts.
        The resulting pattern of shifted points is then converted to a binary array by assigning a value of 1 to each point that falls within a predetermined circular region, and 0 to all other points.
        MURA has several properties that make it useful for various applications, such as its uniform redundancy (each point in the encoded image contributes equally to the overall encoding) which helps to ensure robustness against errors and noise in the imaging or sensing process.
        Those patterns also have good autocorrelation properties, meaning that the pattern is highly correlated with itself when shifted by small amounts. 
        This property is useful for tasks such as image registration and pattern recognition.

    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence"><b>Maximum length sequences (MLS)</b></a>: they are a type of pseudorandom binary sequence i.e. binary sequences that have a maximum possible length for a given number of binary digits.
        An MLS is generated by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), which is a type of shift register that uses feedback to generate a sequence of binary digits.
        The sequence generated by an LFSR is periodic, and the length of the period is dependent on the number of bits in the register and the feedback arrangement. 
        When the LFSR is configured in a way that produces the longest possible sequence, it is called a maximal length sequence.
        Like MURA patterns, MLS have good autocorrelation properties, which means that the sequence is highly correlated with itself when shifted by small amounts, which is useful in applications such as channel estimation and synchronization. 
        Furthermore, MLS also have good cross-correlation properties, which means that the sequence is not correlated with other MLS when shifted by small amounts, which is useful in applications such as cryptography.

    <h3><b>Phase contour</b> (seen in the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9076617">PlatCam</a> article)</h3>
    <p>
        Unlike coded apertures or Fresnel zone apertures, phase contour masks are not amplitude masks, they are phase masks: 
        there are no occlusions, but thickness changes throughout the mask, making the phase of the incoming light changed in the same manner. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The phase contour computation is done by detecting the edges of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a> (a smooth, continuous pattern characterized by subtle changes in value and spatial coherence). 
        The edge detection was done by using the Canny edge detection implemented in the <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html">OpenCV</a> library. 
        Since the basic Perlin noise is to blurry for it to work, we made the edges more easily detectable by mapping the values from [-1,1] to [0,1] and round the noise so that is becomes binary.

    <h3><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-020-0289-9"><b>Fresnel Zone Aperture</b></a></h3>
    <p>
        A Fresnel zone aperture (FZA) is a mask that contains a series of concentric circular rings. 
        It operates on the principle of diffraction: the concentric rings of the zone plate are designed to create constructive and destructive interference patterns, which can be used to focus or manipulate light.
        We computed the FZA pattern by using the following formula, and then rounded it to make it binary:
        $$M(r) = \frac{1 + \cos (\pi r^2)}{2 R^2}$$
        <br>
        The code to obtain such masks war inspired from the code available in <a href="https://github.com/THUHoloLab/FZA_lensless_imaging">this repository</a>.
